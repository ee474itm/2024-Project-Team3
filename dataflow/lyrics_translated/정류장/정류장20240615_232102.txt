##Final lyrics###

At sunset, the wind was howling loud that day
Coming back from home, on the bus ride
Feeling the wind, helpless by the window 
I just sat there, staring into space

Why am I so foolish, so ignorant of life?
Do I not yet know of this world's harsh face?
Biting down my lips to hold back the tears
Standing up as my stop draws close

Dimly in the distance, waiting at the stop
I saw you pacing anxious
Not sure how long you'd been there waiting just for me
Seeing you, I couldn't say a word

I only held you close and the tears started flowing
Endless tears kept falling
If only this could last forever, and never fade away
Oh, to you, my love, I'm grateful you're there

At the bus stop, where the leaves were blowing round
Dimly in the twilight glow
Standing on your toes, searching for my face
Wearing that outfit I bought for you

I just held you close and the tears started flowing
Endless tears kept falling
If only this could last forever, and never fade away
Oh, to you, my love, I'm grateful you're there
