#Final lyrics#

##Verse 1##
At dusk, the wind blows strong
Homeward bound, I’m sittin' by the window seat
Wind blows in, and I couldn't stop it, no
I just sat there dazed and numb

Why am I such a foolish one, a silly bum?
Guess I’m naive to how life can be so tough
Holding back the tears, biting my lips tight
I rose to leave, and then I saw

##Pre-Chorus##
Off in the distance, near the bus stop there
Dimly swaying, I could see
Not sure how long you’ve been waiting in despair
Seeing your feet shuffle, waiting just for me

##Chorus##
I couldn’t say a single word
I just held you and the tears began to fall
Tears just wouldn’t stop at all
If I could stay here forever in this place
Whoa, thank you, love, simply for being you

##Verse 2##
Leaves roll round by the bus stop there
Dimly swaying, I could see
On tiptoe, searching for my face everywhere
Wearing the clothes I bought, oh, you look so sweet

##Chorus##
I couldn’t say a single word
I just held you and the tears began to fall
Tears just wouldn’t stop at all
If I could stay here forever in this place
Whoa, thank you, love, simply for being you

##Bridge##
In this wide universe here
There’s someone who has it harder than us both
Betting my heart will heal soon
Thinking of your love, taking away my gloom

##Chorus##
The world’s smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon
I’ll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
