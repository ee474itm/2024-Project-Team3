It was near dusk, the wind was harsh and wild that day,
On the bus ride home, by the window I did stay,
Caught in a breeze I couldn’t fight, 
Lost in a daydream, gazing through the night.

Why am I so foolish? Why so unaware?
Of a world so cruel, feeling it’s not fair,
Swallowed down my tears, pretended to be strong,
As I stood up to leave, hiding what was wrong.

Through the hazy view, the bus stop drew near,
A blurry scene, but someone waiting here.
I saw you there, pacing back and forth,
Not knowing just for how long you were standing by.

I couldn’t say a word,
Just held you tight, my tears began to fly,
They kept on flowing from my eyes,
If we could stay like this forever more,
Oh, darling, I’m thankful you’re the one I adore.

In the bus stop by autumn’s fallen leaves,
A hazy figure I could faintly see,
Up on tiptoes, looking all around,
In the clothes I bought for you, you were there found.

I couldn’t say a word,
Just held you tight, my tears began to fly,
They kept on flowing from my eyes,
If we could stay like this forever more,
Oh, darling, I’m thankful you’re the one I adore.

I couldn’t say a word,
Just held you tight, my tears began to fly,
They kept on flowing from my eyes,
If we could stay like this forever more,
Oh, darling, I’m thankful you’re the one I adore.
