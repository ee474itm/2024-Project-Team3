At sunset, when the wind was breezy and cool
On my way home, sitting by the bus window, school
Trying to face the wind, can't help it at all
I just sat there so quietly, felt so small

Why am I this foolish, why so naive
In a harsh and cruel world, can't believe what I see
Holding back my tears, biting lips to hide my cry
As I stood to get off, didn't know why

In the distance, the bus stop comes in sight
Faintly swaying, can't know since when you might
Have been waiting there, pacing your feet on the ground
When I saw you there, words just didn't sound

I couldn't say a single word
Held you close, just let my tears pour
Tears kept streaming more and more
If only I could stay like this forevermore
Oh darling, thank you, for you I'm so grateful

By the bus stop where the leaves tumbled all day
Faintly swaying, in a loving sort of way
On your tiptoes looking for my face in the crowd
Wearing the clothes that I bought, without a doubt

I couldn't say a single word
Held you close, just let my tears pour
Tears kept streaming more and more
If only I could stay like this forevermore
Oh darling, thank you, for you I'm so grateful

Keeps on going, I'll never let go
Even if despair is what tomorrow shows
Just look at me, I don’t care at all

You can try but you won't break me
Not even the world can lock me
Do it more, you'll never stop me
All we want is all we'll ever need
Without more excuses or apologies
I'll show my scars and take a bow
For the broken, it's for them now

I am just a regular guy
I have to sing, allow me to try
I am just a regular guy
And so am I

Carry on, carry on
Even if by the end we'll all be gone
With our memories we'll carry on
Carry on
Even if everything should end or fall
Your spirit lives on through it all

Kill me, you can't stop my beat
Not even the world can stop my streak
Try harder, you'll never defeat
We just want everything, that’s our feat

Carry on, kill me you can't stop (carry on)
Not even the world can stop my beat (carry on)
Try harder, you'll never defeat (carry on)
We just want everything that we see (carry on)
