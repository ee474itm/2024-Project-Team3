The night is deep
Wandering lights are dancing around
I’m drunk on this night (tipsy tonight)
Swaying all alone

Already dawn it is
Still I'm just on my own
Not feelin’ all this bad, no

Wish to always stay beside you
But I’m drunk on this night (tipsy tonight)
Just wanna leave right away

Know if you’ll ever understand this sorrow
Oh my shoes, don’t leave me too, oh whoa-oh

One and two memories from my childhood
Watching fairytale stars overhead
Tonight I’ll ride a carriage, tipsy and tired
Gonna chase after the weary moon

The night is deep
Singing lights are all around
I’m drunk on this night (tipsy tonight)
Swaying all alone

Don’t you go, don’t you go
Don’t leave me, please stay close
Like bright red petals tonight
Want to stay at your feet

Just a single time, if you (don’t you go, don’t you go)
Smile for me, even if it was (don’t leave me, don’t you leave me now)
A lie (don’t you go, don’t you go)
I’ll pick that star for you ('cause I won’t go, don’t you go)

When morning comes (don’t you go, don’t you go)
The stars will disappear (don’t leave me, don’t you leave me now)
And what do I do now (don’t you go)
Should I rather just leave, oh whoa-oh

One and two memories from my childhood
Watching fairytale stars overhead
Tonight I’ll ride a carriage, tipsy and tired
Gonna chase after the weary moon

Don’t you go, don’t you go
Don’t leave me, please stay close
Like those bright red petals tonight
Want to stay at your feet

Please hold me close~
