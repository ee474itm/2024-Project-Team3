To the closest sea, 
Where I feel so free,
A solo screen showing just for me,
No more beeping, no alarms to set me free.

Cheesecake in hand,
A big glass if you understand,
Coffee, my way, 
Let's make it ice and take it slow today.

Whoa, it's already twelve, 
But I’m still feeling swell,
One big yawn and a giant stretch too,
What to do today? What should I pursue?

Sunshine hits my face, 
Gentle breeze sends me to a place,
When the weekend comes I'll do as I please,
Clouds drift, we wander with ease,

Closest sea to feel the breeze,
Solo movies whenever I please,
Just letting go, it's all okay,
Driving far, walking these streets today.

For a day, ignore the world's story,
I'm crafting my day, my own glory,
No more stress, no worries at all,
Left, right, my heart answers the call.

On streets unseen, 
Who knows what life's brought,
Without a map, I wander and roam,
For a little joy, sing a new song

Follow the paths, a random flower surprise,
Ducking under the bright sun's skies,
Sit on a bench to find my peace,
Following shadows, my steps release.

Walk with the sun, then the moon's glow,
Want to return, but for now let's go,
Hop on the breeze,
Float with the ease.

When the weekend's here, freedom’s near,
Clouds drift free, we follow, my dear,
Perfect plan, no plan at all,
Secret spots where surprises call,

Coffee shop’s aroma fills the air,
Catching sight of clothes, a stylish glare,
For the weekend, do it all,
No more doubts, just stand tall

Yes, it's fine when the weekend comes,
Just do whatever, follow the freedom drums,
In the closest sea, or a solo screen,
Let’s wander, let's dream.

Driving out, or walking these miles,
I’ll go where my heart compiles,
Following steps where they will lead,
Let's explore, let's feel the need.
